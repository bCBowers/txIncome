#TX Income Analysis

This analysis interogates Ted Cruz's claim that "The Democratic Party, more and more, has become the party of coastal elites. No offense but that party that reads GQ - your target demographic - are successful, urban professionals with a fair amount of disposable income. That’s the heart of the Democratic Party. That’s the heart, by all appearances, of Congressman O’Rourke’s campaign. But that’s not the bulk of Americans" by examining the income distribution of Cruz's voters (along with his opponent Paul Sadler) using the data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study.
